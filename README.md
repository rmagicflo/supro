=====================================


Supro is an open source crypto-currency focused on fast private transactions with low transaction fees & environmental footprint. It utilizes a custom Proof of Stake protocol for securing its network and uses an innovative variable reward mechanism that dynamically balances 100% of its block reward size between masternodes (90%) and staking nodes (10%).

* Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions, called  SwiftX.
* Masternode is a cryptocurrency full node or computer wallet that keeps a full copy of the blockchain in real-time. There are many positive aspects to masternodes as they can increase the privacy of transactions and can contribute to perform instant transactions.
